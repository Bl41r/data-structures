# data-structures
Repo that holds implementations of a variety of data structures, including nodes, linked lists, double linked lists, stacks, and queues.

## Queue
### methods:
- enqueue(value): adds value to the queue
- dequeue(): removes the correct item from the queue and returns its value (should raise an error if the queue is empty)
- peek(): returns the next value in the queue without dequeueing it. If the queue is empty, returns None
- size(): return the size of the queue. Should return 0 if the queue is empty.
