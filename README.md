# data-structures
Repo that holds implementations of a variety of data structures

- push(val) will insert the value ‘val’ at the head of the list
- pop() will pop the first value off the head of the list and return it.
- size() will return the length of the list
- search(val) will return the node containing ‘val’ in the list, if present, else None
- remove(node) will remove the given node from the list, wherever it might be (node must be an item in the list)
- display() will return a unicode string representing the list as if it were a Python tuple literal: “(12, ‘sam’, 37, ‘tango’)”
