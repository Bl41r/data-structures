# data-structures
Repo that holds implementations of a variety of data structures

This branch features the stack data type
- push(value) - Adds a value to the stack. The parameter is the value to be added to the stack.
- pop() - Removes a value from the stack and returns that value. If the stack is empty, attempts to call pop should raise an appropriate Python exception class.
