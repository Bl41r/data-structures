# data-structures

## Repo that holds implementations of a variety of data structures

This branch features the priority queue. A Priority Queue is similar to a queue, except that in addition to a value, each item in the queue has a “priority”. When you pop an item off of the queue, you always get the highest priority item.

#### methods
.insert(item): inserts an item into the queue.
.pop(): removes the most important item from the queue.
.peek(): returns the most important item without removing it from the queue.
